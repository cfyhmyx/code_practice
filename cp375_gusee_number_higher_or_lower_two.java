//We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
//I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
//Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
//However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x.
//You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
//Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

//explaination: traverse each element from 1 to n. For each element, by using binary search, it could either go down or go up,
//then we could get two costs. Select the higher cost as the guaranteed cost to win.
//Then find all the guaranteed cost to get the min value.
